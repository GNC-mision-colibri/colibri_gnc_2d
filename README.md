# Colibrí: GNC 2D models

In this repository you'll be able to find the matlab models and scripts developed by the GNC subsystem (from the [Colibrí Mission](https://www.colibrimission.com/)) for a 2-dimensional analysis of our CubeSat's dynamics.

The Simulink models were made with Matlab version 2019b, so you'll need at least that version to open them.
